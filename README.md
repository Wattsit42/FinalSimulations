For interpreting the xn files each line consists of the (p_x,p_y,x,y) coordinates. The others are straightforward.
In the main python file I have included a description of how to change the "settings" of the program so that you can recreate the simulations if you wish.
Included in this file is also the code for plotting the restricted regions and generating the poincare sections using linear interpolation to find the points of intersection with the surfaces.
This file also contains the code for the generation of the Gauss Legendre order 4 and Runge Kutta order 4 methods.
